# Connecting to the CCR

We'll use the UB CCR computer cluster for the workshop. This
(hopefully) simplifies initial steps in 'getting going', while
introducing the main resource available when your desktop is not
sufficient. See the [appendix][] if you would like to install *R* and
*RStudio* on your own laptop.

Some additional resources:

* [Getting access to CCR](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/getting-access/)
* [Remore Computing for RPCI Researchers](http://hpcapp01/ccr-docs/)

Visit and sign in, using your UB id, from a Roswell Park or UB
network: <https://ondemand.ccr.buffalo.edu>

The next screen will ask for your UB password, and two-factor
authentication.

## From CCR to RStudio

1. Use your browser to navigate to
   <https://ondemand.ccr.buffalo.edu/>. Look under the "GUIs" section,
   and choose 'RStudio Server'.

    <img src='images/CCR-RStudio.png'>

2. Provide details on the next screen, then click 'Launch'

    <img src='images/config.png'>

- 'Cluster': choose "Faculty - privately owned nodes" (these are
    'Roswell' nodes)
  - 'Slurm account': choose your user name.
  - 'Partition': choose 'rpci'.
  - 'Quality of Service (QOS)': choose 'rpci'
  - 'Number of hours requested': choose 2; you'll be unceremoniously
      kicked off after this number of hours, so save any work-in-progress.


3. Clicking the 'Launch' button puts your request for compute
   resources into a queue. You have to wait. Not too long. Hopefully.

    <img src='images/queue.png'>

4. Eventually the CCR finds resources for your job, and the queue
   status changes to 'Running', with a link to 'Connect to RStudio
   Server'. Click on the link to get to your own session of RStudio.

    <img src='images/launch.png'>

## RStudio

We'll use *RStudio* extensively. To get going, copy and paste the
following line into the 'Console'

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source('/projects/rpci/rplect/Rpg520/Rsetdirs.R')
```

   <img src='images/rstudio.png'>

Finally, tell *RStudio* about the changes made by the previous command
by navigating to the lower-right panel, choosing the 'gear' widget',
and selecting 'Go To Working Directory', as in the following figure

   <img src='images/rstudio-config.png'>

OK, we are ready to go!

Feel free to customize your Rstudio session to your liking. There are many [options](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-the-RStudio-IDE).

# Introduction to *R*

## Essential *R*

A simple calculator

```{r}
1 + 1
```

'Vectors' as building blocks

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c("January", "February", "March")
c(TRUE, FALSE)
```

Variables, missing values and 'factors'

```{r}
age <- c(27, NA, 32, 29)
gender <- factor(
    c("Female", "Male", "Non-binary", NA),
    levels = c("Female", "Male", "Non-binary")
)
```

Data structures to coordinate related vectors -- the `data.frame`

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    age = c(27, NA, 32, 29),
    gender = gender
)
df
```

Key operations on `data.frame`

- `df[1:3, c("gender", "age")]` -- subset on rows and columns
- `df[["age"]]`, `df$age` -- select columns

Functions

```{r}
rnorm(5)        # 5 random normal deviates
x <- rnorm(100) # 100 random normal deviates
hist(x)         # histogram, approximately normal
plot(density(x)) # a little more sophisticated?
```

'Vectorized' operations, e.g., element-wise addition without an
explicit 'for' loop. The following creates a vector `y` by
element-wise addition of the 100 elements of vector `x` with 100
random normal deviates.

```{r}
y <- x + rnorm(100)
```

`x` and `y` are related, so place them as columns in a
`data.frame()`. There are 100 rows in the `data.frame()`, `head()`
shows the first 6 rows.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x, y)
nrow(df)
head(df)
```

There is a statistical relationship between `y` and `x`, specifically,
`y` is equal to `x` plus some random noise. Visualize this using
`plot()`.

```{r, fig.asp = 1}
plot(y ~ x, df)
```

It looks like a linear relationship; can we demonstrate this
statistically? Use the `lm()` function to fit a *l*inear *m*odel to
the relationship between `y` and `x`:

```{r}
fit <- lm(y ~ x, df)
fit           # an R 'object' containing information about the
              # regression of y on x
summary(fit)  # statistical summary of linear regression
```

What about adding the regression line to the scatter plot? Do this by
plotting the points, and then adding `abline()` to add the straight
line implied by the linear model fit.

```{r, fig.asp = 1}
plot(y ~ x, df)
abline(lm(y ~ x, df))
```

### A little more advanced...

Write your own functions

```{r}
hello <- function(who) {
    paste("hello", who, "with", nchar(who), "letters in your name")
}
hello("Martin")
```

Iterate, usually with `lapply()` although `for()` is available

```{r}
names <- c("Martin", "Thomas")
lapply(names, hello)
```

## Packages

Packages extend functionality of base _R_. Can be part of the 'base'
distribution (`lm()` is from the 'stats' package)...

```{r}
stats::lm(y ~ x)
```

... or a package contributed by users to the Comprehensive R Archive
Network ([CRAN][]), or to [Bioconductor][] or other repositories.

- CRAN -- more than 20,000 packages (!) <https://CRAN.R-project.org>
  - Use `install.packages()` to install CRAN packages
- Bioconductor -- 2289 packages for high-througput genomic data
  analysis <https://bioconductor.org>
  - First install [BiocManager][] from CRAN, then use
    `BiocManager::install()` to install Bioconductor packages.

[CRAN]: https://CRAN.R-project.org
[Bioconductor]: https://bioconductor.org
[BiocManager]: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager

A particularly common suite of packages is the 'tidyverse'.  To use
the [dplyr][] contributed CRAN package, load the package

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

A dplyr 'tibble' is like a 'data.frame', but more user-friendly

```{r}
tbl <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = x + rnorm(100)
)

tbl # e.g., only displays the first 10 rows
```

The [ggplot2][] package is often used for visualizing data

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

[ggplot2][] uses a 'grammar of graphics' to assemble a plot in layers

```{r, fig.asp = 1}
ggplot(tbl) +                    # use 'tbl' as a source of data for the plot
    aes(x, y) +                  # use columns 'x' and 'y' for axes
    geom_point() +               # add x and y coordinates as points
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")   # add a regression line, with confidence bands
```

## How to Learn *R*

Help

- Every function has a help page, e.g.,

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ?data.frame
    ```

    - Sections with 'Description', 'Usage', 'Arguments' (often with
      defaults), 'Value', 'Examples'
    - Can be quite difficult to follow, but are usually quite helpful.

Vignettes

- Many packages have 'vignettes' that illustrate how the package can
  be used.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    vignette(package = "dplyr")
    ## Vignettes in package 'dplyr':
    ##
    ## colwise                 Column-wise operations (source, html)
    ## base                    dplyr <-> base R (source, html)
    ## grouping                Grouped data (source, html)
    ## dplyr                   Introduction to dplyr (source, html)
    ## programming             Programming with dplyr (source, html)
    ## rowwise                 Row-wise operations (source, html)
    ## two-table               Two-table verbs (source, html)
    ## in-packages             Using dplyr in packages (source, html)
    ## window-functions        Window functions (source, html)

    vignette(package = "dplyr", "dplyr")
    ```

Books

- [Hands-on Programming with R][hopr] introduces *R* programming.
  [The Very Basics][hopr-basics] provides an elementary starting
  point.
- [R for Data Science][r4ds] is a book-length web spanning with both
  introductory and more advanced topics. One of the authors, Hadley
  Wickham, is the author of the [dplyr][] and [ggplot2][] packages,
  among others.

Web resources

- Google can be a great place to find general *R* resource, e.g., 'how
  to do survival analysis in *R*'
- [StackOverflow][] is useful for trouble-shooting particular problems
  -- 'I try to fit a linear model with `lm(mgp ~ cyl, mtcars)` but *R*
  says ..., what am I doing wrong?'.
- ChatGPT & friends can also be useful, especially if asking
  well-focused questions or, e.g., asked to 'explain the following *R*
  code' to help understand code someone else has written. I have
  almost always disagreed with the specific code ChatGPT generates;
  sometimes it simply does not work (e.g., use the package 'X', but
  'X' is not a package), but more dangerous are the situations where
  code is syntactically correct but provides the wrong answer. Use,
  but with extreme care!
  
## How to Learn *Bioconductor*

- Bioconductor packages are *R* packages so they have man pages and vignettes
- Most resources are available on the [Bioconductor Website](https://bioconductor.org/)
