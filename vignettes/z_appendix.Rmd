# Installation

## *R*

Install *R* for your operating system from the Comprehensive *R*
Archive Network [CRAN][]. The box at the top of the page has links for
Linux, macOS, and Windows.

On Windows, see the link [install *R* for the first
time][CRAN-windows]. The link will download an installer that can be
double-clicked. Install as a regular user, not as a system
administrator.

On macOS, use the 'R-4.3.2-arm64.pkg' installer for newer (M1 / M2
macOS) and 'R-4.3.2-x86_64.pkg' for Intel macs.

Linux systems can of course be more complicated; follow the links for
your operating system.

[CRAN-windows]: https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/base/

## *RStudio*

It is possible to use *R* without using *RStudio* (this is how I
usually use *R*, for instance), but many people use the open-source
version of *RStudio*. Download the open-source version of [RStudio
Desktop][RStudio] from Posit, the company that produces *RStudio*.

# Packages

If you are installing *R* on your own laptop for the purposes of this
course, you'll need to install the packages that we use.  *R* on the
CCR has many packages pre-installed. But there are more than 20,000
packages in CRAN and Bioconductor, so at some point you will need a
package that is not installed.

Follow this general approach. Note that packages only need to be
installed *once*; once installed, they can then be used in separate
*R* sessions using `library()` or the `pkg::function()` notation.

## CRAN package installation

Start by creating a vector of packages to install. For this workshop,
we used the following packages.

```{r}
pkgs <- c(
    "readr", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2",
    "plotly", "survival", "ggsurvfit"
)
```

Use `setdiff()` (remove from the vector in the first argument all
elements that occur in the vector in the second argument) so that only
packages that are not currently installed remain.

```{r}
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, rownames(installed.packages()))
```

Finally, use the function `install.packages()` to install the required
packages from a central CRAN repository.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(pkgs, repos = "https://CRAN.R-project.org")
```

## Bioconductor packages

[Bioconductor][] packages require a slightly different installation
procedure. Make sure that you have the [BiocManager][] package
installed from CRAN

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgs <- "BiocManager"
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, rownames(installed.packages()))
install.packages(pkgs, repos = "https://CRAN.R-project.org")
```

Then install [Bioconductor][] (and CRAN) packages as needed

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgs <- c(
    "cellxgenedp", # Bioconductor package
    "Seurat"       # CRAN package
)
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, rownames(installed.packages()))
BiocManager::install(pkgs)
```

[BiocManager]: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager

## Updating packages

`install.packages()` and `BiocManager::install()` report packages that
are out-of-date because a newer version is available. Usually it is a
good idea to be using the most recent version available. There are two
situations when you might wish to continue using older packages.

- A tight deadline (e.g., thesis defense, paper submission). Updating
  packages can sometimes introduce changes that break existing code,
  and it can be time consuming to track these down.

- Reproducibility. Packages sometimes introduce changes that result in
  (hopefully slightly) different outcomes, perhaps because the
  packages adopts a newer algorithm. This might not be desireable,
  e.g., when a paper has been submitted and the reviewer says 'this is
  excellent expect ...' it requires a minor addition to the orginal
  analysis, but when you try and reproduce your original analysis it
  is no longer possible because of changes in the underlying software.

  There are a number of strategies for taking a 'snapshot' of software
  versions used in a particular analysis (e.g., the [renv][] package),
  and if you become serious about using *R* it is very valuable to
  explore these resources *before* you need to reproduce them.

## FAQ: binary or source packages?

On Windows and macOS, one might sometimes see a message that indicates
a 'binary' package is available, but the 'source' package is more
recent. Almost always the best response is to stay with the 'binary'
package -- the more-recent 'source' package will likely be made
available in a short time frame (within a week), and if not indicates
that the package is difficult to install even by the wizards at CRAN
-- mortals like you and I will have to become very proficient to
install Windows or macOS packages from source.

# Data used in this workshop

Datasets used in this workshop are available on the CCR. They can also
be accessed on the internet. The URL for each dataset is the
`base_url` pasted before the file name used in this document. Thus the
ALL dataset is available at

```{r}
base_url <-
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtmorgan/RPG520/main/inst/extdata/"
ALL_url <- paste0(base_url, "ALL.csv")
```

It can be read directly into *R*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
all <- readr::read_csv(ALL_url)
```

Or downloaded to disk for easy re-use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download.file(ALL_url, "ALL.csv")
```

# Questions arising

## 'tidy' versus 'wide' data

Suppose you observed tumor weight on 5 mice over 3 weeks. You could
represent this data as a `tibble` / `data.frame` with columns 'mouse',
'week', 'tumor\_weight'.

```{r tidy, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
tbl <- tibble(
    mouse = rep(LETTERS[1:5], each = 3),
    week = rep(1:3, times = 5),
    tumor_weight = runif(15)
)
tbl
```

Each row represents an *observation*. Each column represents a
*variable*. Each combination of 'mouse' and 'week' is associated with
an *observation* of 'tumor_weight`. **Tidy data simplifies data
management** and we use it throughout the workshop. For instance, it's
easy to compute the average tumor weight each week

```{r tidy_avg_wt}
tbl |>
    group_by(week) |>
    summarize(n_mice = n(), av_wt = mean(tumor_weight))
```

Or to add another observation, e.g., `mouse_weight`

```{r tidy_mutate}
tbl |>
    mutate(mouse_weight = 5 + rnorm(15))
```

Our original data on `tumor\_weight` could be represented in a 'wide'
format, e.g.,

```{r wide}
tbl |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(
               names_from = "week", names_prefix = "week_",
               values_from = "tumor_weight"
           )
```

This representation might be useful for summary in a paper or
presentation, but it is less easy to manipulate, e.g., what is the
average tumor weight each week? how can we add 'mouse\_weight` to this
data?
               
The [tidyr vignette][tidyr-vignette] provides a more detailed
discussion of these issues.

## *R*-flavored markdown

Markdown is a great plain-text format for writing documents and
reports. *R*-flavored markdown allows *R* code 'chunks' to be embedded
in the markdown document. The document can then be processed to, e.g.,
plain markdown or html or slides to share with others. During
processing the *R* code chunks are evaluated. This means that you can
can describe what and why you're doing something, then show what you
actually did, and present figures or tables summarizing your
results. This is a great tool for reproducible, communicable research.

An easy way to start is to use the 'File -> New File -> R Markdown...'
menu in *RStudio*. This generates a demonstration document that you
can tweak and explore. Build it to HTML by pressing the 'knit...'
button on the markdown document pane. A [cheat
sheet][rmarkdown-cheatsheet] provides some further hints. Ask Google
for additional questions.

## Creating an *R* package

An *R* package can be a great way to bundle an analysis into a
reproducible unit, or to share new analysis methods you've developed
with colleagues.

I asked ChatGPT to tell me how to 'create an *R* package using
devtools, usethis, and roxygen2', and got a pretty good starting point
-- give it a try! The package I mentioned in my query are

- [devtools][]: use `create()` to make a package skeleton,
  `load_all()` during package developement to load the current package
  into your *R* session, `check()`, `build()`, and `install()` to
  check that your package is syntactically correct, build it into a
  'tar ball' for sharing with others, and install it in your *R*
  library for subsequent use via `library(YourPackage)`.
- [usethis][] for adding components to your package, e.g.,
  `use_vignette()` to add a vigentte, `use_mit_license()` (for
  instance) to add a license that indicates how you allow your package
  to be used by others, etc.
- [roxygen2][] for documenting functions in your package.

Package vignettes (e.g., `vignette(package="roxygen2")`) and Google
are great resources during package development.
